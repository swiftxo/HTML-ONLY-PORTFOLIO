    <h1>Sohan's Favourite Animes</h1>

<h2>My top 3 most favourite animes</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Re:Zero</h3>
<P>One of the most well written isekai. It is very brutal to the protagonist and I see alot of my self in him.</P>

<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p> An extremely well written mystery shounen. It has insane foreshadowing, starting from the first episode.</p>

<h3>Tada Never Falls In Love</h3>
<p> This one just brings me nostalgia.</p>
